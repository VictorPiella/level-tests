# Responsive Numbers

The aim of this exercise is to check your ability to make a responsive UI by only manipulating CSS and HTML

1. Open `index.html` and look how it is rendered by default
2. Try to render it like that, this is a full width and full height display, but try to not have to scroll
![How it should look like](screenshot.png "Responsive Numbers")
3. Bonus: to not crop too much numbers on small devices, try to add dedicated rules for devices with less than `width: 600px`


* Add your own rules in `styles.css`
* You can modify `index.html`, but we advise you to not change the `ul>li>span` structure on which some basis rules are applied
* The display should be same in IE11 or above, Firefox and Chrome for their latest version
* DO NOT modify `base.css` which contains the basis for this exercise
* Don't forget to submit what you've done, even if it's not working or not finished. That will be discussed during next interview.

We expect you to do your best, don't stress yourself, it's ok to skip some parts

**Good Luck!**
